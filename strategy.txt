* Plot the original expected data
    o Seeing it has a clear trend
    o Seeing it has multiple x project to same y in coordination

* Making fitting strategy decision
    o Since it has clear trend, and it is not linear nor simple polynomial function, I decide to throw linear regression algorithm.
    o Since we will lose about 40% data, we might still have a dense dataset. I try first to use K nearest neighbor algorithm.
    o Further observing the plot, K should not be big, otherwise I will get a plain curve. I decide to implement easy algorithm,
    just take nearest 2 available right neighbor. For the beginning and ending points, iterate till we have available neighbors,
    and use that 2 available points to fill the null point.
